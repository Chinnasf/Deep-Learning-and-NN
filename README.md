### Content Description

**`NN_Noisy_Moons.ipynb`**<br>
The code contains a simple example of how to implement a neural network with a 1-hidden layer. The datasated is generated through `sklearn`'s funcion [`make_moons`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.make_moons.html). 

The libraries used are: 

* `numpy`
* `sklearn`
* `matplotlib`
